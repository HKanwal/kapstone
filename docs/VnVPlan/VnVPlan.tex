This document is the verification plan for the \progname{}. The primary focus of this document is to outline the plan for the testing of the \progname{}, ensuring that it meets the requirements detailed in the SRS. This document will go over the general information of the project, provide a section on the general planning for testing, and finally provide concrete tests for both the functional and non-functional requirements, taken from the SRS. \wss{provide an introductory blurb and roadmap of the
  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

The \progname{} is a software that is intended to provide customers an easy way to find and meet with mechanics for their automobiles. It will allow shop owners to create their shop in an application, provide services to clients, book appointments with them, and provide them with quotes for their services. Clients will be able to search through shops in the system and send requests for quotes to many shops. Clients will also be able to quickly make appointments with shops for the services they provide that don't need a quote. The bottom line is that the \progname{} facilitates communication between clients and shop owners.

\subsection{Objectives}

The objective of this document is twofold: To provide both current and future developers an easy way to verify and validate both the requirements that have already been implemented in the project, as well as the future requirements, and also to demonstrate to any viewer that the software has reached a point where it can be adequately used as a minimal viable product.
\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}


The relevant documentation for this project includes the Software Requirements Specification for the \progname{}.
\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

To execute the team's verification and validation plan, each team member was given a role. The following table explains each member's responsibilities.

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

As this is an industry project, the SRS cannot receive feedback from fellow members of the course. Because of this, the verification of the SRS is more internal than other projects. For feedback from an outside source, the supervisor of this project, Nabil Ibrahim, will be consulted for feedback on the requirements in the SRS. When a requirement is added to or removed from the scope of the project, Mr. Ibrahim will again be consulted, depending on his availability. In addition to consulting the supervisor of this project, before implementing requirements into the system, a few questions will be asked:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Is the requirement relevant to the project?
    \item Is the requirement impossible to verify?
    \item Is the requirement achievable within the first phase of the project?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent If the answer to any of these questions is no, then the requirement will be reexamined and removed, improved upon, or left as-is, depending on the discussion. It is hoped that this process will help verify the SRS as a whole.
\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may include
  ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may plan for 
  something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

According to the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, our design exists in a superposition of varying degrees of correctness. It follows that there exists a world in which our design is 100\% correct and, given that such a world is guaranteed to exist, verification of our design is not necessary.

The above logic presents us with an issue, however. Though there exists a world with a perfectly correct design, it is unlikely to be the world we find ourselves in. So, how do we verify our design in this more likely scenario? Since our project is very much dependent on our partner, Sayyara's, vision, it is vital that our design is reviewed by our supervisor, Nabil Ibrahim. This review will take place during a meeting with our supervisor in which we describe and walk through our design, while receiving his feedback.

Additionally, the design shall be reviewed by all team members to ensure technical details are correct.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

The verification of this verification plan shall be outsourced to independent, third-party auditors, also known as ``Teaching Assistants''. These auditors shall review this document and evaluate it according to a predetermined set of criteria, eventually producing an evaluation score, also known as a ``grade''. This ``grade'' shall be given to the writers of this plan, also known as the ``students'', to serve as a gauge for the quality of this document.

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

To test our implementation, the team shall implement all of the unit tests and end-to-end tests listed in this document, in addition to further unit tests discovered to be useful after implementation has been completed.

During development pull requests must be reviewed by at least one other team member before they can be merged into the main branch. This is a means of verification of the implementation via manual code inspection.

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

The tools we will be using, including testing libraries, frameworks, and continuous integration tools, have already been thoroughly detailed in our development plan. Below is a brief summary, but it is recommended that the reader look at "Section 6 - Technology" of our development plan to read a complete description.

For the front-end, the linter we are using is ESLint. ESLint can also be used to ensure full code coverage. Our front-end testing frameworks will be Jest and Cypress. Jest will be used for unit testing, while Cypress will be used for end-to-end testing.

For the back-end, the linter we are using is pylint. Our back-end testing framework will be the base django test framework..

To facilitate continuous integration, we are using GitHub actions. As an additional tool that was not mentioned in our development plan because we had not planed to deploy our project, we are using Vercel to facilitate continuous deployment of both our main branch and all development branches of our GitHub repository.

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

There is no external data that can be used for validation. Instead review sessions with our stakeholder shall be conducting to validate our software.

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

The following subsections cover the various functionalities of the system. Each set of test cases relate to a specific subsystem. Each test case relates to one ore more functional requirements as specified in the SRS.

\subsubsection{Shop Owner Registration}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

The following subsections are divided according to non-functional requirement sections in the SRS. Each subsection contains tests that verify relevant non-functional requirements.

\section{Non-dynamic Test Description}

This section will go over the any non-dynamic tests that the team plans to use to verify the software.

\subsection{Code Review}

The utilization of version control alongside code review will be used to systematically find faults in the software before it is integrated into the main branch. At least 1 approval of any modifications to the codebase is required to be gotten before the modifications can be merged. In this way it is hoped that any bugs with code are found before they are merged (even if that notion is unrealistic).

\subsection{Document Review}

Document review will be carried out as required on documents at fixed times, at milestones of the project. They will be carried on each document as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Upon completion of revision 0.
    \item Upon the completion of any related document.
    \item Before work is carried out to create the final project.
    \item Before the deadline for the final documentation.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Document review may or may not include the supervisor depending on the relevance to the supervisor, and/or the availability of the supervisor. In the case the project supervisor is available, feedback will be elicited from him in meetings to ensure that documents remain relevant to the scope of the project. In the case that the supervisor is not available, internal review will be carried out on each document to ensure it aligns with the current state of the project.

\subsection{Walkthroughs}

Informal walkthroughs will be performed, as needed, when a given team member has issues thinking of test cases for a given component. As such, the primary purpose of walkthroughs for this project is to generate test cases, and figure out expected outputs to said test cases. The given team member and at least one other team member will group together, inspect a piece of code, and brainstorm different test cases. Once a valid test case is thought up, the group will draft different outputs to different inputs, making sure to include normal inputs, fringe cases, etc. Test cases generated through this method will then be turned into dynamic tests that will be run by the continuous integration portion of this project on all new changes to the system.

% \section{Unit Test Description}

% \wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
%   philosophy for test case selection.}  
% \wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design

% \wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
%   developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
%   verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
%   have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
%   explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

% \subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

% \wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
%   appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
%   technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

% \subsubsection{Module 1}

% \wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
%   References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
%   perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
%   tests were selected.}

\subsubsection*{Approaches}

A possible approach to understanding the topic of End-to-End testing is to read online guides such as guru99 and browserstack. These websites provide an overview of relevant concepts, necessary steps and best practices. Another strategy is to watch tutorial Youtube videos that explain the topic. Both approaches are free but quality Youtube videos are less readily available. 

To understand how to effectively survey users, team members can use online content such as Youtube videos and articles that define strategies to survey users. This approach is free and widely available online. Another strategy would be to learn through trial and error by creating small surveys and surveying friends and family to discover effective strategies. This method could provide hands-on, real-world experience but may be time consuming.

To get familiar with Jest, Pytest and Cypress testing frameworks, team members can watch tutorial Youtube videos. These videos will provide an overarching crash course on the testing framework to allow team members to understand concepts and practices. Team members can also follow along on their own machines to further understand and have hands on learning. This approach would be free and easily accessible, but may not be as in-depth as other approaches. Another approach would be to take a Udemy course on the testing frameworks. This method will provide more hands-on learning but may also be much more time consuming. Finally, the team can use online documentation and tutorial websites to review the framework and get a better understanding of syntax and methods. This approach would require the team to dig through a lot of content and does not provide hands-on examples, but would be free and easily accessible.

\subsubsection*{Chosen Strategies}

To gain knowledge in end-to-end testing, the team has decided to use online written guides on websites such as browserstack and guru99. This will allow them to move at their own pace and take notes on the subject. It is free to access and the sites provide high quality explanations. If the team requires further knowledge, they will look to Youtube to fill in the gaps.

To understand user surveying, the team will use online content such as videos and articles to discover best practices and apply it to the usability survey being used for this project. This is the least time-consuming approach and provides the best way to gain knowledge quickly. 

To learn specific testing frameworks such as Jest, Pytest and Cypress, the team has chosen to use Youtube tutorials. Through research, the team was able to find a full and in-depth crash course on jest and cypress that will provide all the necessary knowledge with no cost to the team. To supplement our learning, the team will also reference official documentation for the frameworks to further understand syntax and specific methods we will be using.
