<The files and folders have been set-up with tex files that have external links
so that cross-referencing is possible between documents.>

<The tex files Common.tex so that they can share definitions.>

<The files use Comments.tex so that the comments package can be used to embed
comments into the generated pdf.  Comments can be set to false so that they do
not appear.>

<None of the files are complete templates.  You will need to add extra
information.  They are just intended to be a starting point.>
