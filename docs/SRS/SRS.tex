This SRS closely follows the Volere template provided by the course instructor, however it uses some parts of the initial template as well. However, it covers the same sections as both templates, so no big changes have actually occurred. Some of the subsections that were not relevant to the project were omitted from these templates.

\section{Introduction}

This section provides an overview of the rest of the document. It describes the purpose of this document, outlines the expected knowledge of the reader and provides a roadmap of the SRS.

\subsection{Purpose of Document}

  The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of \progname{} and outline the expectations of the program for functionality and performance. The document will describe the purpose of the system and its features and constraints. This SRS will also indicate conditions under which the system will be developed. This document is intended to be read by stakeholders and developers to achieve a better understanding of the system.

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}

  The intended audience for this document are developers and other stakeholders such as project managers, quality assurance and product experts. It is assumed that these readers have a basic understanding of Progressive Web App (PWA) development and server hosting. It is also assumed that the reader understands the process for car maintenance, including quotes, work orders and billing.

\subsection{Organization of Document}

  The document is divided into sections that each give an in-depth look into an aspect of the system. To begin, the \hyperref[sec:GSD]{General System Description} section describes the system and identifies how it will interact with its environment and users. This section will also summarize the attributes of the expected users. The following section, \hyperref[sec:SSD]{Specific System Description}, will describe the purpose of the system through the problem statement and explain necessary terminology for complete understanding of the problem and requirements. The \hyperref[sec:FuncReq]{Functional Requirements} section will outline the needs of the client and expectations of the software, in terms of functionality. This section will also describe the scope of work, formal requirements and the plan for how the team intends to implement the functional requirements. Following that, the \hyperref[sec:NFuncReq]{Nonfunctional Requirements} section will explain all quality features the team plans to implement in this project. The current environment for this system will be discussed in the \hyperref[sec:PI]{Project Issues} section, to present all factors that will contribute to the success or potential failure of \progname{}. Finally, the \hyperref[sec:refAppendix]{Reflection Appendix} details the skills and knowledge each team member requires in order to complete this project and the proposed action plan accepted by each member. 

\section{General System Description} \label{sec:GSD}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints.

\subsection{System Context} \label{sec:SystemContext}

The system context for this PWA is shown in Figure 1. This figure shows the relationship between the user inputs and the different parts of the software that the users interact with. The figure starts at the User box which shows the first stage of user input which is the user logging in as a customer, shop owner or shop employee. From this stage they are guided to the respective front end view of the PWA relevant to their access level and from these front end PWA views they have various interactions and user inputs that will interact with the database and have various outputs as shown by the arrows in the figure.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{SystemContext}
\caption{System context displaying user interactions with PWA views and database. }
\label{Fig_SystemContext} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

The end users of the system can be of two types, a typical consumer and a typical shop owner or employee. The general consumer will not be expected to have any knowledge about auto motives, and as such it will not be required to use the software. In general, the typical consumer is expected to know how to use a mobile app or web page (which will be the output of this project, see \hyperref[constraints]{System Constraints}) without any instruction. Finally, general consumers are assumed to have no physical disabilities that may prevent them from using the system. 

Shop owners/employees are expected to have all the same general knowledge as a typical consumer but with knowledge relating to the automotive industry in addition. In particular, this type of user will have knowledge about the terminology and processes used in the auto motive industry, and as such, they will not be explained to any potential users. Shop owners or employees are expected have the knowledge to be able to assist consumers in their understanding of auto motives to allow them to more effectively use the application.

\subsection{System Constraints}
\label{constraints}

This system has no constraints, barring one. The output of the project, as mandated by the supervisor of the project, will be a PWA (progressive web app). This means that the output of the project will take the form both of a web page that can be run in a browser, but also an application that will run on mobile devices. 

\section{Specific System Description} \label{sec:SSD}

This section presents the problem description, which gives a high-level view of the problem to be solved. In addition, it contains a section detailing any terminology used in the document that may be unclear for readers.

\subsection{Problem Description} \label{Sec_pd}

\progname{} is intended to solve a typical issue that a consumer may run in to when attempting to service their vehicle: finding a reliable mechanic, and creating appointments with them. Consumers may have to phone many mechanics to find a mechanic that charges a reasonable price for services, and may not necessarily even be able to find a time slot that works for both the mechanic and them. \progname intends to solve these issues with coordination for both consumers and mechanics, making servicing vehicles easier for the both of them.

\subsubsection{Terminology and  Definitions}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent
sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it
easier to correctly understand the requirements:

\begin{itemize}

\item \label{term_cannedJob} Canned job: a job provided by a shop where the pricing and timing is already listed, so there is no need for a customer to request a quote or for the shop to send a quote to the customer.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution Characteristics Specification}

This section covers the assumptions that may affect the requirements if changed in the future.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}

Many assumptions about the users of the system are detailed under \hyperref[SecUserCharacteristics]{User Characteristics}, but the following assumptions are also made:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The mobile hardware that a user has will support PWAs.
    \item When using the application, the user will have a valid internet connection.
    \item The servers that eventually host the system will be able to support the users of the system.
\end{itemize}

\noindent If there is a change in these assumptions, the functional requirements defined in the following section may be subject to change.

\section{Functional Requirements} \label{sec:FuncReq}

This section provides the functional requirements, the business tasks that the
software is expected to complete, and the nonfunctional requirements, the
qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}

\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}

The system context is covered in Section \ref{sec:SystemContext}

\subsection{Formalized Requirements}

The following Parnas table, \hyperref[tab:formal]{Table 2}, will formalize the utilization of the system between customers and shop owners/employees, one of the most important parts of the system. It will use the following variables to represent interactions, with abbreviations as neccesary:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Stimulus:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In\_Chat: The customer or shop opens a chat with each other.
        \item In\_CustomerR: The customer makes an appointment with a shop.
        \item In\_ShopR: The shop owner/employee accepts a customer request.
        \item In\_Complete: The appointment with a customer is marked as complete.
    \end{itemize}
    \item State:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Init (I): Initial state, can be considered to be a landing page.
        \item ChatWin (CW): The customer can chat with the shop and vice versa.
        \item AppShop (AS): The shop can see an appointment request from the customer.
        \item AppAcc (AA): The customer can see their request has been accepted by the shop.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Issues} \label{sec:PI}

\subsection{Open Issues}

In the current automotive ecosystem, it is a hassle for the average motorist to find an auto service professional they can trust and that provides the most affordable services. The process requires many phone calls to be made and the consumer is required to describe the same problem multiple times.

From the opposite perspective, it is difficult for shop owners to accurately provide estimates on when they would be available to service your vehicle.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

There are many automotive repair related apps already on the market, but even the best of them are only able to fulfill a subset of the aforementioned problems. One such app, GoMechanic Car Services, provides price estimates, appointment booking, and an accessory shop, but it is limited to a single automotive repair shop franchise, and does not allow independent repair shop owners to leverage the platform. Furthermore, it is only available in India, and such an alternative does not yet exist in North America.

Another app, Simply Auto: Car Maintenance, focuses more on providing an accurate maintenance schedule and providing cost summaries and other cost related features, such as attaching receipts, and calculating taxes. This app fails, however, to provide easy appointment booking, and other helpful features that allow the consumer to stay connected with repair technicians.

\subsection{Tasks}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Complete documentation as required.
    \item Setup repository, initialize project codebases, and setup continuous integration pipeline.
    \item Receive the product requirements from our industry partner.
    \item Create the relational database model.
    \item Create the UI design on Figma.
    \item Implement features.
    \item Demo features to partner and interview our partner for clarification on the requirements.
    \item Repeat previous two steps until the final product is created.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}

The app will be designed to be easy to learn for both users that are completely new to these types of apps, as well as for users that have already used a similar solution in the past.

\subsection{Risks}

The back-end server could go down, but this has a low likelihood of occurring if we host it on a popular cloud provider such as AWS or Google Cloud. In general, this project is not safety critical, so there are no other major risks.

\subsection{Costs}

This project has no costs for development other than the cost incurred by the students to take this course.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}

Documentation is not required for this project as our industry partner only desires a MVP to showcase to prospective investors. There is no training required to use this system.

\subsubsection{Approaches}
A possible approach to gain knowledge and enhance skills in front-end and back-end technologies including React, NextJS, TailwindCSS, Django, Postgresql and PWA technologies is by taking online courses through Udemy or Coursera. These courses are usually paid but will give an in-depth tutorial and overview about the specific front end technologies. Another approach is to use free sources such as Youtube and written tutorials on websites such as geeksforgeeks or w3schools. This option will not cost the team but will require the team members to create their own syllabus and do more self-teaching. 

To learn project management skills, team members could study project management methodologies through online documentation. This could also include Github projects and issue documentation, to learn how Github will be used to manage project work. Another strategy would be to meet with a project manager to shadow his work or learn from a 1-on-1 on how to implement project management skills in this project effectively.

Enhancing time management skills could be done by adopting a tight schedule for this project and using calendars, agendas, and to-do lists to track progress. Another way to develop this skill is to set SMART goals and work with another team member to check-in on individual progress to ensure goals are being met on a regular basis.

\subsubsection{Chosen Strategies}
For learning domain-specific technologies, all team members have decided to use free outlets such as Youtube and tutorial websites to source relevant information for the technologies they require more knowledge in. This approach was chosen to keep costs for each team member low and also the team was able to find helpful free resources that will allow them to gain necessary knowledge.

To enhance project management skills, Tevis and Harkeerat will review methodologies and documentation online. Harkeerat will specifically focus on Github documentation. This method was chosen by both team members as it will be much less time consuming than reaching out to a project manager and both members only require small refreshers to contribute to the project effectively.

Caitlin has chosen to improve her time management skills by adding our project schedule to her calendar and making sure to stay on track by consistently tracking progress with to-do and priority lists. Caitlin has chosen this strategy as she already keeps a calendar for other courses and can easily apply it to this project on a more rigid scale to increase her time management.
