\section{Django Testing}

This section will detail the unit tests that relate to the back-end of the project, utilizing Django. The first section will detail common unit test cases, with the second section going into more specific tests performed.

\subsection{Common Tests}

For each model included in the back-end of the project, a test was implemented to test the creation of the model. The input for these tests were values to fill each instance of the model with, and the expected result was that each value in the instance matched the expected value. It should be noted these tests were only created for models created by our team, and not models available by default in Django, nor the ones imported from libraries. An example of one such common test is as detailed in this table:

\begin{longtable}{|>{\raggedright\arraybackslash} p{.15\linewidth} |>{\raggedright\arraybackslash} p{.2\linewidth} |>{\raggedright\arraybackslash} p{.23\linewidth}|>{\raggedright\arraybackslash} p{.23\linewidth} |>{\centering\arraybackslash} p{.08\linewidth}|}

\hline
\end{longtable}

Test input data varies for each different model, however, valid inputs were chosen for these types of tests, as their purpose is to verify the integrity of the models in case they are changed. Below is a graph summarizing the results of the tests:

    \label{fig:creation_chart}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Specific Unit Tests}

Apart from the above common tests, some models require more specific tests for the custom methods the team created. This section will detail these extra tests. Some inputs will be in plain text, while others will use plain language for better descriptions.

\section{Changes Due to Testing}

After concluding testing and receiving feedback from the usability survey, a number of changes and upgrades have been considered for the next revision of the project. For the functional tests, three tests failed due to missing features needed to achieve functional requirements. The features, which include shop owner account details/edit page, employee deletion, and search bars for all list pages, will be added in the next development stage of the application. All functional tests will be re run to ensure proper integration of the features. 

Furthermore, taking feedback from our surveyed focus group, we will be improving how navigation works throughout our application to enhance usability. We will also confirm all pages have uniformity in fonts, spacing and elements to improve visual appeal. Lastly we will be implementing a feature to enable customers and shop owners to comment on quotes and quote requests based on feedback given at the Rev0 demo.

\section{Automated Testing}

A limited number of front-end component-wise unit tests were written using Jest, a library for testing React components. Smoke tests were written for key components. These tests would check that each components renders correctly, and with the correct styles. These tests were then set to run on each commit using GitHub actions.

\section{Non-Dynamic Testing}

As specified in the VnV Plan, the team undertook different types of non-dynamic testing to verify and validate the application. This section will detail the results.

\subsection{Code Review}

Upon attempting to push code into the main branch of the GitHub repo, a code review was performed. Code required at least 1 member of the team to review and approve it in order to be implemented. The member who wrote the code would, if required, provide information about what was implemented and how to test it, and the member reviewing the code was allowed to suggest changes.

\subsection{Document Review}

Document reviews were carried out as each document was completed. If applicable, related documents were also reviewed. Document reviews consisted of the team reviewing documentation in order to determine if it met the current status of the project. If the document was not up to standards, it was updated accordingly.
\\\\
\noindent
At the current moment in time, a final documentation review has not been done, however, before the completion of the project, each document will be reviewed separately.

\subsection{Walkthroughs}

Informal walkthroughs were performed to generate test cases for the Verification and Validation Plan. Team members paired up with one other member to inspect parts of the code and generate test cases. Through this method test cases, along with various inputs for the given test cases were thought up and written into the Verification and Validation Plan, and eventually implemented into the code base to be run using continuous integration.

\section{Further Results}

This section will cover any further verification or validation that was carried out as part of the project.

\section{SRS Verification}

As listed in the Verification and Validation plan, requirements described in the SRS were validated. Requirements were evaluated and modified in order to meet the specified criteria.

\section{Design Verification}

The design of the project was created using Figma, as described in the project's design documents. Verification was carried out by consulting our Supervisor, Nabil Ibrahim. According to Mr. Ibrahim's comments, the design was modified and updated to meet his needs.

\section{Automated Tools}

As specified in the Verification and Validation plan, automated testing tools were used to facilitate easier development on the project's code-base through the use of GitHub Actions.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Appendix --- Usability Survey Results}
\label{sec:AppSurveyResults}
The following figures are charts gathered by Google Forms depicting our usability survey results. For each question, a rating was provided on a scale of 1 to 5 (where 1 represents a poor review and 5 represents a strong review).
